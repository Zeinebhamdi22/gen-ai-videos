# 🐾 Hoplophoneus – AI-Generated Video

This project showcases a short video and GIF of **Hoplophoneus**, an extinct prehistoric predator, created entirely with Generative AI tools. From concept to final visuals, this project explores how AI can bring ancient creatures back to life — digitally.


## 🛠️ Tools Used
