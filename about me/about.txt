🎥 My First AI-Generated Video : A Project About Me

This project showcases my first AI-generated video ,a creative piece that represents who I am. 
It blends storytelling, AI tools, and creative editing to produce a unique personal introduction.

 🧠 Tools & Technologies Used

Here’s a breakdown of the tools I used to bring this video to life:

- ChatGPT: for writing the video script and generating creative prompts.
- RunwayML: for generating the video content using AI-powered video models.
- Suno AI: to generate background music that complements the mood and style of the video.
- ElevenLabs: to synthesize human-like speech for the voiceover.
- Clipchamp: for editing and assembling the final video (montage).

 💡 Why This Project?

I wanted to explore the capabilities of Generative AI and combine different models into a single pipeline — from text to speech, video, music, and final editing. 
This project represents my identity, my technical creativity, and my passion for AI.
